## Description

_Cryptosquare: Write a method to convert a user inputted string into 5 character units of encrypted code. This is accomplished by mapping the string (minus blank spaces and non-alphanumeric characters) onto a grid that is as close to square as possible. To create the encrypted code, the square is read back in the opposite orientation as it was initially mapped. Then a counter is used to add a space every five characters, before the code is printed._
